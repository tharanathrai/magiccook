<h1>Introduction</h1>
<b>MagicCook - The Smart Chef</b> is an application designed to improve your quality of living by
making recommendations for what to cook; keeping your lifestyle and medical needs in
mind. Why spend time stressing over what you can and cannot eat, when MagicCook has got you
covered! <br><br>

This web application is designed to allow users to choose their lifestyle and diseases (if any)
after which, they can select core ingredients that they currently have access to. MagicCook
will return the list of all possible dishes that can be prepared, keeping all constraints in mind.
